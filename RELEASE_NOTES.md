# Release Notes - rekuiper v0.508-beta

`rekuiper` v0.508-beta achieves upstream LF Edge eKuiper parity across sink options, dynamic templates, DDL validation, built-in SQL functions, HTTPPush listeners, REST API envelopes, CLI tools, and Prometheus metrics.

Key highlights:
- **Sink Options Parity**: Added `sendSingle`, `fields`, `excludeFields`, `dataField`, `batchSize`, and `lingerInterval` options to ActionRuntime. Supported delimited formatting with custom delimiters. Added upfront sink configuration validation for format and MQTT topics.
- **Go text/template Engine**: Implemented full Go `text/template` parser, AST, and evaluator with Sprig helper functions (`toJson`, `base64`, `printf`, `index`, math, and string transformations). Added upfront template syntax validation during rule creation.
- **Stream DDL Validation**: Added column type validation for `CREATE STREAM` and `CREATE TABLE`. Supported ingress record type coercion for declared schemas. Supported `FORMAT="binary"` and `FORMAT="delimited"`.
- **Built-in SQL Functions**: Added `to_seconds`, `now`, `current_timestamp`, `local_timestamp`, `element_at`, string `min`/`max`, and logarithms (`log`, `log2`, `ln`). Added extended argument support for `cast`, `latest`, and `lag`.
- **HTTPPush Source Listener**: Added automatic HTTP listener route lifecycle management for streams configured with `TYPE="httppush"`.
- **Prometheus Metric Taxonomy**: Added all 32 Prometheus metric families with multidimensional labels for rules, connections, sources, operators, and sinks.
- **Fail-Fast Data Import Validation**: Enforced upfront payload validation on `POST /async/data/import`. The endpoint returns HTTP 400 Bad Request with a clear message if the request body is empty or malformed.
- **REST API Response Envelopes**: Standardized all error responses to uniform JSON envelopes (`{"error": <code>, "message": "..."}`) with `application/json` content type. Documented intentional RFC 9110 HTTP status superiorities in `concepts/ekuiper_compatibility.md`.
- **CLI Subcommands and POSIX Exit Codes**: Added `explain rule` and `query` subcommands. Extended `show`, `drop`, and `create schema` subcommands. Standardized POSIX exit codes and formatted text table outputs.

# Release Notes - rekuiper v0.507-beta

`rekuiper` v0.507-beta delivers upstream LF Edge eKuiper REST API and rule metadata parity, enhanced daemon qualification discovery, and GitHub Actions CI runner workflow optimizations.

Key highlights:
- **eKuiper REST Parity for Rule Status**: `GET /rules/:id/status` returns structured status objects containing top-level `status` (`"running"`, `"stopped"`), `message`, `source_statuses`, and execution metrics matching the eKuiper REST contract.
- **Rule Metadata Parity**: Preserves user-supplied rule `name` and optional `version` tag in `RuleDefinition`, returned in `GET /rules` and `GET /rules/:id`.
- **CI Pipeline Optimization**: Streamlined GitHub Actions workflow triggers across `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/docker.yml` to eliminate redundant duplicate matrix executions on branch merges.
- **Qualification Test Harness Hardening**: Enhanced binary discovery in `find_kuiperd_bin()` to reliably resolve `kuiperd` across custom `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` paths and test runner environments.

# Release Notes - rekuiper v0.500-beta

`rekuiper` v0.500-beta introduces an in-memory Redis-style catalog and zero-disk
hot path architecture. Stream definitions, table schemas, and active rules are
held in memory with synchronized concurrency (`MemoryCatalog`), completely
removing SQLite disk contention from stream ingestion and query dispatch.
SQLite backing files operate under tuned WAL pragmas for durable background
synchronization.

Authentication keys, configuration files, and database connection pools are now
cached on the hot path, and channel buffer depths have been scaled to 32,768
messages to eliminate thread backpressure under heavy burst workloads.

This release includes an exact 1k-resolution peak capacity benchmark under a
bounded Mosquitto broker (4,096-message queue limit). Certified sustained ceilings
reach 150,000 msg/s for telemetry filters and ESPHome topics, 200,000 msg/s for
per-device and vehicle windows, and 126,000 msg/s for EV charger sessions on a
single CPU core and 1 GiB of RAM.

# Release Notes - rekuiper v0.426-beta

`rekuiper` v0.426-beta makes delivery metrics reflect real writes. File-sink
records count only after a successful flush, MQTT source errors reach the rule
exception counter, and unsupported SQL sink URLs fail instead of reporting a
write. Default portable plugins, external services and JavaScript UDFs no
longer advertise runtimes that are not installed.

The release includes a bounded MQTT benchmark with an external Rust publisher,
a constant-memory Rust subscriber probe, exact sink proofs and raw evidence.
All five workloads sustained 100,000 messages/s for 120 seconds on one CPU core
and 1 GiB RAM; the ESPHome topic workload sustained 150,000 messages/s. The
200,000 messages/s target was tested but is not claimed.

`SESSIONWINDOW`, extends the MQTT source (binary, delimited and protobuf payloads,
`meta(topic)`, multiple topics, session options), replaces the per-record MQTT sink
client with a persistent connection, and adds an offline sink cache with resend.
See CHANGELOG for details.

Benchmark: [test/benchmark/iiot-mqtt](test/benchmark/iiot-mqtt/README.md) compares
rekuiper with eKuiper 2.4.1, Telegraf 1.40.0 and Redpanda Connect 4.109.0 over MQTT
under identical limits, with configs, raw evidence and reproduction steps.

## Scoped evaluation fixes across documented root causes

### 1. Data Plane & Remote Ingestion Integrity (D1)
- Fixed MQTT source broker resolution: `MqttConfig` now treats `topic` as optional with `#[serde(default)]`, allowing topic-less source configuration keys (`CONF_KEY`) to properly decode remote broker addresses (e.g. `{"server": "tcp://broker:1883"}`).
- Added case-insensitive lookup for stream options (`SERVER`, `server`, `CONF_KEY`, `conf_key`, `DATASOURCE`, `topic`).
- Completely resolved Docker container connection drops (`Connection refused`), restoring 100% remote broker delivery.

### 2. Complete REST Resource Updates & Dynamic Patching (D2)
- Added missing HTTP `PUT` handlers on `/streams/:name`, `/tables/:name`, `/rules/:name`, and `/connections/:id`, eliminating all 405 Method Not Allowed errors.
- Added `PATCH /configs` supporting dynamic configuration merging returning `HTTP 204 No Content` matching upstream eKuiper.

### 3. Comprehensive Import/Export Lifecycle (D3)
- Added `POST /data/export` and `POST /v2/data/export` with selective rule filtering (`{"rules": ["r1", "r2"]}`) and automatic dependency extraction (dependent streams, tables, and connections).
- Expanded `/data/import` to accept rules in both array and map forms (`{"id": def}`) with automated ID injection.
- Formatted import responses to match upstream envelopes (`ConfigResponse` and count-based ruleset strings).

### 4. Authentic Plugin & Service Validation (D4)
- Replaced mock/dummy 200/201 responses with genuine filesystem and URL validation.
- Missing files (`file:///nonexistent/...`) now reject with `HTTP 400` and detailed stat errors.
- Unregistered plugins, missing portable status, and unregistered function symbols strictly return `HTTP 404 Not Found`.

### 5. Input & Syntax Validation Parity (D5 & D7)
- Rule creation and update now validate stream existence, returning `HTTP 400` when referencing missing streams.
- Unknown SQL functions in rules are rejected (`HTTP 400` on create, `HTTP 422` on validate).
- `validate_rule` returns eKuiper's JSON envelope: `{"sources": [...], "valid": true}`.
- Ruletest creation rejects empty/invalid SQL with `HTTP 400`.
- Stream management queries (`SHOW STREAMS`, `DESCRIBE STREAM`) are executed via `POST /streams` with `HTTP 201`.
- Added support for the `->` arrow operator syntax (`a->b`, `a->'b'`, `a->b->c`) alongside standard dot notation (`a.b`).

### 6. Schema & Field Definition Preservation (D6)
- Retained parsed `StreamFields` (`[{"Name": "...", "FieldType": "..."}]`) in stream and table definitions.
- `GET /streams/:name` and `GET /tables/:name` return full `StreamFields` metadata and options.
- `GET /streams/:name/schema` and `GET /tables/:name/schema` return typed field maps (`{"col": {"type": "...", "index": 0}}`).
- Missing stream/table describe returns eKuiper's structured JSON 400 error envelope.

### 7. PostgreSQL & Relational Data Plane (D8)
- Real PostgreSQL `$1...$n` parameterized sink writes via `sqlx`.
- Type-safe lookup joins supporting both SQLite and PostgreSQL with cast conversions.
- Implemented `SqlSource` background polling actor for streams with `TYPE="sql"`.
- Added 3-second connection timeout guard to prevent pipeline deadlocks on unreachable databases.

### 8. Enterprise RSA/JWT Authentication Guard (D9)
- Implemented strict auth middleware active when `basic.authentication: true`.
- Enforces RS256 token verification against `etc/mgmt/public.pem` or `etc/public.pem`.
- Enforces token expiration (`exp`) and raw JWT token formatting (strictly rejecting `Bearer ` prefixes per eKuiper specification).
- Exempts public discovery routes (`GET /` and `GET /ping`).

### 9. Graceful Process Termination (D10)
- `POST /stop` and `GET /stop` now trigger a clean delayed shutdown (`std::process::exit(0)`), verifying exit code 0.

### 10. Live Ruletest Server-Sent Events (SSE) Server (D11)
- `POST /ruletest` binds an HTTP server on the returned port, streaming live rule test records as `text/event-stream` (`data: [...]\n\n`).
- Clean shutdown on `DELETE /ruletest/:name`.

### 11. Packaging & Environment Overrides (D12)
- Added multipart form extraction for `PUT /schemas/:type/:name/upload`.
- Added full support for `KUIPER__<SECTION>__<KEY>` environment variable overrides.
