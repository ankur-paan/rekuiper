This guide documents the automated differential qualification harness. The harness verifies that `rekuiper` serves as an exact drop-in replacement for LF Edge `eKuiper` v2.4.1 across REST APIs, state persistence, error boundaries, streaming transformations, and mathematical calculations.

## 1. Differential Architecture

Differential testing runs both engines concurrently on an isolated bridge network with supporting edge infrastructure:

```
                          +------------------------+
                          |  Mosquitto MQTT Broker |
                          |      (:1883 TCP)       |
                          +-----------+------------+
                                      |
                 +--------------------+--------------------+
                 | Ingestion Topic: `devices/telemetry`    |
                 v                                         v
     +-----------------------+                 +-----------------------+
     |   rekuiper (Target)   |                 | eKuiper 2.4.1 (Ref)   |
     |   (:9081 HTTP REST)   |                 |   (:9091 HTTP REST)   |
     +-----------+-----------+                 +-----------+-----------+
                 |                                         |
                 | Sinks: `out/rekuiper/<rule_id>`         | Sinks: `out/ekuiper/<rule_id>`
                 v                                         v
        +------------------------------------------------------+
        |      Differential Test Harness & Parity Ledger       |
        |      - Exact payload comparison within 1e-3 epsilon  |
        |      - Schema structural validation                  |
        |      - Performance, memory & crash resilience checks |
        +------------------------------------------------------+
```

## 2. Ingestion and Broker Configuration

In edge container topologies, both engines connect to external or shared brokers through `confKeys`.

### Register a Broker Connection

```bash
# Register shared broker on rekuiper
curl -X PUT http://localhost:9081/metadata/sources/mqtt/confKeys/e2e_broker \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"server": "tcp://kuiper-mosquitto:1883", "qos": 0}'
```

### Define a Stream with ConfKey

```sql
CREATE STREAM telemetry () WITH (
  FORMAT = "json",
  TYPE = "mqtt",
  DATASOURCE = "devices/telemetry",
  CONF_KEY = "e2e_broker"
);
```

## 3. Verified Formula and Transformation Categories

During qualification, the test harness streamed 100 complex telemetry records simultaneously to both engines under load.

### 1. Mathematical Formulas and Precision

Both Go (`float64`) and Rust (`f64`) engines produce identical numerical results within $|v_1 - v_2| \le 10^{-3}$ epsilon:

```sql
SELECT 
  abs(vibe) AS v_abs, 
  ceil(temp) AS t_ceil, 
  floor(temp) AS t_floor, 
  round(temp, 1) AS t_round, 
  sqrt(abs(voltage)) AS v_sqrt, 
  power(voltage, 2) AS v_pow, 
  (voltage * current) AS power_calc, 
  round(sin(temp), 3) AS t_sin, 
  round(cos(temp), 3) AS t_cos, 
  round(ln(abs(voltage)), 3) AS v_ln, 
  round(exp(1.0), 3) AS e_const 
FROM telemetry;
```

### 2. String Manipulation

- Standard regex replacement: `regexp_replace(status, "ACTIVE", "RUNNING")`
- Native string replacement: `replace(status, "ACTIVE", "RUNNING")` (rekuiper native optimization)
- Transformations: `upper()`, `lower()`, `concat()`, `length()`, `trim()`, `ltrim()`, `rtrim()`

### 3. Conditional Branching and Null Safety

```sql
SELECT 
  device_id, 
  CASE 
    WHEN temp > 35.0 THEN "CRITICAL" 
    WHEN temp > 22.0 THEN "WARNING" 
    ELSE "NORMAL" 
  END AS alert_level, 
  coalesce(nullable_val, -999) AS val_coalesce, 
  isNull(nullable_val) AS is_null_val 
FROM telemetry;
```

### 4. Deep JSON Paths and Array Subscripts

- Nested properties: `geo.lat`, `geo.lon`, `config.level`
- JSON path queries: `json_path_query(config, "$.mode")`
- Array operations: `readings[0]`, `cardinality(readings)`, `array_contains(readings, 20.0)`

### 5. Stateful Window Aggregations

```sql
SELECT 
  count(*) AS win_cnt, 
  sum(temp) AS win_sum, 
  round(avg(temp), 2) AS win_avg, 
  min(temp) AS win_min, 
  max(temp) AS win_max 
FROM telemetry 
GROUP BY CountWindow(10);
```

## 4. Chaos and Resilience Testing

The differential test harness executes targeted chaos injections to verify zero data loss:

1. **SIGKILL Crash Recovery**: Kills the `rekuiper` process during active stream execution. Upon restart, SQLite WAL recovery restores all stream and rule definitions without data loss.
2. **Broker Partition and Egress Caching**: Disconnects the Mosquitto broker while publishers continue sending data. `rekuiper` buffers events in memory and replays queued records upon reconnect.
3. **Concurrent Mutation Flooding**: Thirty concurrent threads issue rapid rule CRUD operations (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`). All operations serialize cleanly without deadlocks.

## 5. Execute Test Suites

Automated test suites reside in `ekuiper/test/e2e_diff/`:

```bash
# 1. Run complete 154-scenario REST lifecycle, chaos, and stress suite:
python3 test/e2e_diff/run_differential_tests.py

# 2. Run real telemetry stream processing and formula verification suite:
python3 test/e2e_diff/run_data_formula_tests.py
```

- `test/e2e_diff/DATA_AND_FORMULA_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`
