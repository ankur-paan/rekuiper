The following built-in functions do not belong to other function categories.

## ISNULL

```text
isNull(col)
```

Returns true if the argument value is null.

## COALESCE

```text
coalesce(expr1, expr2, ...)
```

Returns the first non-null value from the argument list. Returns null if all expressions evaluate to null.

## NEWUUID

```text
newuuid()
```

Returns a random 16-byte UUID string.

## TSTAMP

```text
tstamp()
```

Returns the current timestamp in milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970.

## EVENT_TIME

```text
event_time()
```

Returns the int64 timestamp of the event that the rule processes currently. Processing latency can cause this timestamp to be earlier than the current system time.

When you use this function as an aggregate function in a window rule, the function returns the window end time.

## RULE_ID

```text
rule_id()
```

Returns the identifier of the active rule.

## RULE_START

```text
rule_start()
```

Returns the start timestamp of the rule as an int64 integer.

## MQTT

```text
mqtt(topic)
```

Returns the metadata of the MQTT message. This function operates identically to `meta`, but you can only use it when an MQTT message triggers the rule.

## META

```text
meta(topic)
```

Returns the metadata of a specified key. The key format supports:

- A standalone key when the `FROM` clause contains only one source, such as `meta(device)`
- A qualified key that specifies the stream, such as `meta(src1.device)`
- A nested key path for multi-level metadata, such as `meta(src1.reading.device.name)`. This format assumes that `reading` is a map data structure.

## LAST_HIT_COUNT

```text
last_hit_count()
```

Returns the number of times that the condition evaluated to true. Use this function to get the accumulated trigger count of a continuous rule. When you use this function in a `WHERE` clause, the function increments the count only when the condition is true.

Do not use this function in an aggregate rule, except in the `WHEN` clause of a sliding window. To get the hit count in an aggregate rule, use [last_agg_hit_count](./aggregate_functions.md#last_agg_hit_count).

When used in a sliding window trigger condition, the function updates the count when the trigger condition evaluates to true, regardless of the rule outcome.

## LAST_HIT_TIME

```text
last_hit_time()
```

Returns the int64 timestamp of the last event time that evaluated to true. Use this function to get the last trigger time of a continuous rule. When you use this function in a `WHERE` clause, the function updates the timestamp only when the condition is true.

Do not use this function in an aggregate rule, except in the `WHEN` clause of a sliding window. To get the hit time in an aggregate rule, use [last_agg_hit_time](./aggregate_functions.md#last_agg_hit_time).

When used in a sliding window trigger condition, the function updates the timestamp when the trigger condition evaluates to true, regardless of the rule outcome.

## WINDOW_START

```text
window_start()
```

Returns the window start timestamp as an int64 integer. Returns 0 if no time window exists. The timestamp aligns with the time configuration of the rule. If the rule uses processing time, the function returns the processing timestamp. If the rule uses event time, the function returns the event timestamp.

## WINDOW_END

```text
window_end()
```

Returns the window end timestamp as an int64 integer. Returns 0 if no time window exists. The timestamp aligns with the time configuration of the rule. If the rule uses processing time, the function returns the processing timestamp. If the rule uses event time, the function returns the event timestamp.

## GET_KEYED_STATE

```text
get_keyed_state(key, dataType, defaultValue)
```

Returns the value for the specified key from the state database. The first parameter specifies the key. The second parameter specifies the data type of the value (`bigint`, `float`, `string`, `boolean`, or `datetime`). The third parameter specifies the default value if the key does not exist.

The default database is SQLite. Configure an alternative database in [external-state](../../configuration/global_configurations.md#external-state).

## DELAY

```text
delay(delayTime, returnVal)
```

Delays rule execution for a specified duration and then returns the value in `returnVal`. Specify `delayTime` as an integer in milliseconds.
